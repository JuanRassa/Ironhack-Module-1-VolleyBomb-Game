## About the project

![Volleybomb Screenshot](/assets/game-screenshot.png)

Volleybomb is an exciting local-multiplayer game built with JS, CSS and HTML with a Retro-Pixel-Christmas-StyleÂ®.

Players will be kicking a "bomb" to each other that will explode if it touches the ground or if its timer is over. The first player to score 5 points wins.

Our main inspiration for this game was the classic [Slime-Volley](https://oneslime.net/), and we want it to mix it with something related to avoid the explosion of a bomb.

We hope you have fun with it, as we did while building the game! :)
